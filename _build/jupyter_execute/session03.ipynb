    "- **encapsulation**: functions can be used by other programmers without requiring knowledge of the implementation\n",

Functions are executed by calling them; **function calls** use the function's name followed by parentheses, possibly containing a number of arguments within the parentheses. Note that functions can only be called *after* they have been defined.\n",
