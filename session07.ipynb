    "## For efficiency's sake: structured programs, packages, regular expressions \n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency is key. Therefore, in this session, you will learn more about advanced aspects of efficient programming. We have already discussed how to improve code efficiency and maintainability in small programs. Sooner or later, however, additional questions may emerge: How should you **distribute code over a main program and importable modules**? Where can time and effort be saved by relying already available **modules** and **packages**? Can **repeating patterns** in the task at hand be detected and exploited for further automization? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Structured programs\n",
    "Python code (in .py files) can be used in two ways:\n",
    "- as a standalone program (e.g., the code file that you run from within Spyder)\n",
    "- as a module that is imported and used from inside another program\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recap**: Any .py file can be loaded as a module. As such, modules allow us (a) to distribute code across multiple files (which is convenient for bigger coding projects). Modules are loaded with an *import* statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Larger projects should make use of the distinction between standalone programs and modules.**\n",
    "- package the main functionality in different Python files\n",
    "- import these files as modules from a main file where the execution code resides\n",
    "- this main code should only be executed when the code is run as a standalone program"

    "#### The *main* block\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon importing a module, **all statements in the imported module are executed**. This may be fine if the module is explicitly design with a singular intended function as module imported to other programs. But **sometimes you may want to be able to use a script as both a module and an executable standalone program in and of itself**. This is where the *main* block comes in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why would you want this functionality?**\n",
    "- Your code's **main function may be for use as module**, but you still want to include a script mode where it runs some **unit tests or a demo**.\n",
    "- Your code's **main function may be for use as standalone program**, but you still want to **make some of its functionalities available to other programs**, without needing to create a new .py file.\n",
    "- Finally, your code may be for **use as standalone program (by you)**, but may have some unit tests and the **testing framework (by your teachers)** works by importing .py files like your script and running special test functions. This is the case for your homework exercises."
