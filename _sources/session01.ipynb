    "In this course, you will learn the basics of programming. Our language of choice will be **Python**, a *high-level dynamically-typed* programming language. You will learn what that means later on. No prior knowledge in programming is required. At the end of this course, you should have acquired the general-purpose knowledge relevant for learning how to program in *any* higher-level programming language, you should have learned how to write and interpret basic programs in Python, and you should be able to break down complex (data analysis) problems into a series of algorithms aimed to solve the task at hand.  \n",
