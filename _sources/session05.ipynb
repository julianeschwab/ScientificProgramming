    "\n",
    "**So far, all of our Python programs were self-contained**, that is, they did not rely on external data files or pieces of code (except for in-built Python functions and methods). In most real-life situations, however, you will work off of existing files (e.g., for data analysis) or from pre-existing code (e.g., when adding new functionalities to an app or program). In this session, you will learn how to **import and use** external Python code as **modules** and how to **create, read from, and write to files**.\n",

    "### Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modules are python files intended for use in other Python programs**. Any *.py* file can be loaded as a module. As such, modules allow us **(a)** to **distribute code across multiple files** (which is convenient for bigger coding projects), and **(b)** to make use of **collections of useful functions** provided by other programmers. Many modules come with Python as part of the default installation. One such example is the *Itertools* module we saw in the previous session. Others include the *math* module and the *random* module, which contain helpful functions for mathematical operations and for probabilistic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules are **loaded with an *import* statement** (more below). Upon importing them, **all statements in the imported module are executed**.  \n",

    "In the following, we will focus on the *math* module:\n",

    "- *import math*: makes all objects available as math.object\n",
    "- *from math import func*: makes math.func available as func\n",
    "- *from example import long_function_name as func*: makes math.function_name_in_module available as func_name_in_my_code"
